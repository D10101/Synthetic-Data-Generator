Multiple Generative AI algorithm options are available in the overall SDG solution toolkit, including GANs, Variational Autoencoder, GPT-4 and many others.
These algorithms help create synthetic data that closely follows the patterns and distributions of the original business data.



So in this SDG Based On few Rows tab you can give a few rows of original input data and what it does is that after harnessing historical patterns,
it dynamically generates synthetic data, to ensure a realistic representation of past trends.
It enhances the dataset by augmenting individual rows that is already present and adds a few more rows in such a way that the new synthetically generated data has 
similar data characteristics with the original data that is being fed into the model.



So what we saw earlier in the first tab was row augmentation where we had few rows but now in this second Tab we are going to generate data using no rows with this schema.
We will give a json file as input here which has various data types present in it.
Now by processing this Json file, it swiftly generates synthetic data, adhering strictly to the defined schema, offering flexibility 
and precision in data creation.​



Tackling extreme rarity, the third tab (Edge Case Generation) specializes in crafting synthetic data for edge cases with near-zero probabilities, 
enhancing the robustness of models against scenarios that do not happen in general.​
Edge Case Generator addresses the challenges of generating edge case data efficiently, even when it has low probability.
The generated edge case data maintains the distribution of the original data.
It handles conditional probability for both character and numeric data types.


In the fourth tab SDG addresses issues related to imbalanced data.
Addressing model training challenges, the fourth tab (Imbalanced Dataset Fix) transforms imbalanced datasets into balanced ones, optimizing the learning process of models 
and ensuring fair representation across classes. 


In the Fifth Tab we have developed a powerful tool which is designed to generate time series data dynamically, thereby providing flexibility for users to retrieve 
data based on either past or future reference points.
The key features are the Backward and Forward options.
Selecting the backward option allows users to retrieve all data preceding a specific date. This feature is particularly useful for historical analysis and trend identification. 
Opting for the forward option enables users to obtain all data following a chosen date. This functionality is valuable for forecasting and staying ahead of trends.


The Sixth Tab supports the generation of synthetic text data. We have developed this cutting-edge tool – a Synthetic Text Generator powered by OpenAI and this innovative solution
utilizes prompt engineering to dynamically generate synthetic reviews.
What sets this tool apart is its unique ability to filter out redundant content, ensuring each review is distinctive and tailored to your specific requirements.
In conclusion this Synthetic Text Generator not only harnesses the power of OpenAI's language model but also employs advanced techniques to ensure the diversity and 
uniqueness of generated content.
One of it's key features is it's customised content creation based on the user's requirements.
